Abstract: Stellar stream and dark matter detection are active areas of research in astrophysics. Historically, this detection has been a manual process and has led to the discovery of stellar streams such as GD-1 and Palomar 5. If astrophysicists initially have strong conﬁdence that certain stars are part of a stellar stream, probabilistic methods may determine the likelihood that an adjacent star also belongs to the same stellar stream. Usingmachinelearningmethods,weseektodevelopanautomatedprocess that ﬁnds additional stars that are part of the stellar stream. After initially trying standardized classiﬁcation methods, we establish an ensemble of a subset of kNN methods(ESkNN)as an effective means of classifying stars from simulated streams and real streams. Since these methods generally fail to capture non-linearities in the data, we also use a feedforward neural network approach that we expected to help capture non-linear properties. Our evaluation metric for these two metrics is the F1 score. The best model produced by ESkNN method had an F1 score of 0.75, when evaluated on GD-1 stars. The deep learning method (DeepSets) achieved an F1 score of 0.66. While both approaches can be tuned to prefer precision or recall, the ESkNN tends towards highly precise results (99%) whereas the DeepSets method tends towards results with high recall. We also attempt a metric learning approach that could help uncover a distance learning metric that is an improvement upon Euclidean distance.
